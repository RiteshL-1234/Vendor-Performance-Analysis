# Vendor-Performance-Analysis



This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance in the retail and wholesale industry to optimize profitability, reduce risks, and improve operational efficiency. The workflow begins with defining the business problem, which emphasizes challenges like underperforming brands, inventory inefficiencies, vendor dependency, and pricing mismatches.

The next step involves data preparation. Using SQL, multiple database tables are explored, merged, and cleaned to form an aggregated table. This aggregated dataset is stored in the database and further analyzed in Jupyter Notebook using Python. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and solving research questions related to vendor sales, profit margins, inventory turnover, and cost optimization.

Key insights include identifying low-performing vendors with high margins, evaluating the impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost savings, and detecting slow-moving inventory that ties up capital. Correlation analysis helps assess relationships between sales, pricing, profitability, and stock turnover. Hypothesis testing is applied to validate differences in vendor profitability models, providing statistically sound conclusions.

To enhance decision-making, the project integrates visualization. The aggregated data is used to create interactive dashboards in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to monitor vendor performance, compare profitability, and track inventory efficiency in real time.

Finally, a comprehensive report documents findings, insights, and actionable recommendations. These include re-evaluating pricing for low-sales brands, diversifying vendor partnerships, leveraging bulk purchasing, and optimizing slow-moving inventory. The project demonstrates the full data pipeline: from raw data to meaningful business insights and decision-ready dashboards.

By combining SQL for data handling, Python for analysis, and Power BI for visualization, this project showcases an end-to-end approach to data-driven vendor performance analysis that enhances profitability, mitigates risks, and strengthens supply chain efficiency.
